## About This Framework 📝
Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework designed for building web applications with minimal overhead. Following a "micro" philosophy, it provides a simple core while allowing developers to add extensions as needed, making it ideal for small to medium-sized projects or rapid prototyping.

## Features List ✨
- **Lightweight Core**: Minimal setup with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
- **Extensible Design**: Integrate extensions for databases, authentication, and more.
- **Built-in Development Server**: Quick setup for testing and debugging.
- **Jinja2 Templating**: Powerful template engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
- **RESTful Request Handling**: Simplifies building APIs with robust request processing.

## Getting Started Guide 🚀
1. **Install Flask**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```
2. **Create a simple app**:
   Create a file named `app.py`:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def home():
       return 'Welcome to Flask!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```
3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see your app.

## Example Projects 📂
- **Blog Application**: Create a simple blog with posts and comments, using Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management.
- **To-Do List**: Build a task tracker with user authentication via Flask-Login.
