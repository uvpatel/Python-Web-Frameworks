## About This Framework üìù
Django is a high-level Python web framework designed for rapid development of secure and scalable web applications. It follows the "batteries-included" philosophy, providing a powerful ORM, admin interface, and built-in security features to help developers build robust apps quickly.

## Features List ‚ú®
- **Robust ORM**: Simplifies database interactions with Pythonic models.
- **Automatic Admin Interface**: Provides a customizable dashboard for managing app data.
- **Built-in Authentication**: Handles user login, registration, and permissions.
- **Secure by Default**: Includes CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and more.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports projects from small apps to large-scale platforms.

## Getting Started Guide üöÄ
1. **Install Django**:
   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```
2. **Create a new project**:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject myproject
   cd myproject
   ```
3. **Create a simple app**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```
   Add the app to `settings.py`:
   ```python
   # myproject/settings.py
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...,
       'myapp',
   ]
   ```
   Define a view in `myapp/views.py`:
   ```python
   from django.http import HttpResponse

   def home(request):
       return HttpResponse("Welcome to Django!")
   ```
   Map the view in `myproject/urls.py`:
   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from myapp.views import home

   urlpatterns = [
       path('', home, name='home'),
   ]
   ```
4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your app.
